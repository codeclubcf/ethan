About Minecraft
Minecraft is a sandbox construction game created by Mojang AB founder Markus Persson, and inspired by the Infiniminer, Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper games. Gameplay involves players interacting with the game world by placing and breaking various types of blocks in a three-dimensional environment. In this environment, players can build creative structures, creations, and artwork on multiplayer servers and singleplayer worlds across multiple game modes.
Minecraft is available to all players for €19.95 (US$26.95, £17.95). When purchased, singleplayer and multiplayer game modes can be played using a web browser or the downloadable stand-alone launcher. Minecraft Classic is available to play for free. Minecraft development started around May 10, 2009, and pre-orders for the full game started being accepted on June 13, 2009. Minecraft's official release date was November 18, 2011. On April 5, 2013, Minecraft for the computer reached 10 million sales.
On August 16, 2011, Minecraft - Pocket Edition was released for the Sony Xperia Play gaming smartphone. After its exclusivity with Sony expired, it was released for Android devices on October 7, 2011, and iOS devices on November 17, 2011 for US$6.99.
On May 9, 2012, Minecraft was released for the Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Arcade for US$20, where it subsequently broke every previous sales record.
On February 11, 2013, Minecraft: Pi Edition was released for the Raspberry Pi. It is based on the Pocket Edition and is available for free at Mojang's dedicated blog. The Pi Edition is intended as an educational tool for novice programmers and users are encouraged to open and change the game's code using its API.
On December 17, 2013, Minecraft was released for the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Store for US$19.99. The release was almost identical to the Xbox 360 Edition and was developed in tandem with the Xbox 360 Edition from then on.
